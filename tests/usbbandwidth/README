This script measures the bandwidth available at the USB connection on the raspberry pi. The teensy boards should be set to continually get as much data as possible.
In tests, I have seen 262 kB/s for each teensy even when multiple ones are connected via a hub - not sure what to make of it as surely the total usb bandwidth should be limited?
